It will be something similar to Amazon and <strong>with their karma points the users will get a special discount</strong>. What are the benefits for the small businesses? A huge potential for sales. Our audience is already interested in that kind of products and is more likely to purchase from a trusted site that also offer them a small discount.</p>

There will be a section called "Educate yourself" where the users can watch video tutorials on how to properly meditate or on how to make the perfect veggie cake or whatever they want to learn. They will also get a few karma points by creating appropriate contents.</p>
