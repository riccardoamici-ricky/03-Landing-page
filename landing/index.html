        All the people that take part to the event will receive 10 Karma points.<br><br>Another example:<br>
        <br><strong>Name:</strong> human kindness<br><strong>When?</strong> 07.11.2020 from 17PM<br><strong>Where?</strong> Leopoldplatz<br><strong>What will we do? </strong>Distribute cooked food to homeless people.<br>

        <p><a id="faq_2">S</a>mall businesses can post their plants in this section. <br>What are the benefits? A <strong>huge</strong> potential for sales. <br>Our audience is targeted and is more likely to purchase from a trusted site that also offer them a small discount.<br>Why plants? We believe that working, living and living spaces should be modelled on the great spaces of nature and enrich our lives both inside and out.</p>

        <p><strong>Target</strong><br>Gen Z. Everyone who wants to leave their mark on this planet.<br>Those who are always so busy that don't have time to join any  association or charity but would still like to help people in need.<br>
        <strong>What's the problem?</strong><br>
        Social media are full of toxic contents. <br>Society is sick and all we do is just sit on the sofa complaining about the next thing we hear on the radio.<br>

        <strong>What I propose:</strong><br>
        A place to go where users can find inspiring events in a couple of clicks and gain a discount to buy plants and educate themselves on how to take care of them.</p>
